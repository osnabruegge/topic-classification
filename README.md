# Cross-Domain Topic Classification for Political Texts

This repository includes scripts and models used in the paper:

Osnabr√ºgge, Moritz, Ash, Elliott and Morelli, Massimo. 2021. "Cross-Domain Topic Classification for Political Texts". Political Analysis, 1-22, doi: https://doi.org/10.1017/pan.2021.37.

The folder "models" includes the classifiers trained using the 44-topic and the 8-topic specifications. The folder also includes data on the vocabulary.

The folder "scripts" includes scripts to predict the topics of a text based on these models. In the paper, we use the trained models to predict the topics of parliamentary speeches. However, the trained models can also be applied to other texts.
